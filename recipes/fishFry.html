    <h2>Discription</h2>
    <p>fish fry or diamond fry in Calcutta is a crumb-coated fillet of bhetki—something that would be called a fish cutlet elsewhere. Fish fry is served by cabin-style restaurants, small take-away shops, street food vendors, as well as in catered events such as weddings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fish</li>
        <li>Fish Fry Powder</li>
        <li> Oil</li>
        <li>Lemon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lay the fish fillet on a tray and wipe them with an absorbent cotton cloth or paper towels until completely dry. Leave the tray uncovered in the fridge for a few hours to let it dry further.</li>
        <li>Prepare a marinade by grinding together onion, coriander leaves with roots, flat leaf parsley, green chillies, garlic, ginger, salt, Bengali garam moshla, MSG, sugar, black pepper, and lime juice.</li>
        <li>Smear the marinade uniformly over the fillet. Turn the fillet and coat the other side well.</li>
        <li>Let the fish marinate for 20–30 minutes in the refrigerator.
        </li>
        <li>After 30 minutes add beaten eggs, and plain flour (maida) and mix well. Be gentle.</li>
    </ol>
